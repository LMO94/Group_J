Description of the project:

Your company is participating in a two-day hackathon promoted to study the mobility of bicycle users. We are a team of Data Scientists in the company's roster. By promoting cycling awareness, our company expects to contribute to the green transition.

In the showcase notebook one can see the classes and methods we defined to analyse the given dataset. To avoid Code deprecation we created a virtual environment that contains all the libraries we used.
The goal of the project is now to analyse which month has the most bike rentals.
